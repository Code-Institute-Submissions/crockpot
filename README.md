## Technologies used
### Languages and frameworks
<!-- - __HTML5:__ The language used to create the content and structure of my project.
- __CSS3:__ The language used to style the HTML5 elements to create the aesthetic of my game.
- __JavaScript and JQuery:__ The language used to program my game and make aspects of the 'Home' and 'Tutorial' pages dynamic.
- __Bootstrap framework:__ I used the Bootstrap grid system to make my site responsive on different devices. I also used it for the carousel and modal components on the 'Tutorial' and 'Game' pages.
- __GitHub:__ I used GitHub to store my source code and repository.
- __GitHub Pages:__ I used GitHub Pages to deploy my project and make it viewable to others.
- __Gitpod:__ I used Gitpod's development environment to write the code for my project. -->

### Additional tools used
<!-- - __101soundboards:__ I used 101soundboards.com to find all of the sound effects used through the site.
